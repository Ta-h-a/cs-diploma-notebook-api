        Information Technology is crucial to the majority of the business and has a great influence on 
innovation and engineering. Every branch of engineering and every organization opt for computers
and IT skills  for business automation, communication/connectivity, resource planning, work 
automation and securing information etc. All engineering diploma students must be conversant with 
the basic IT skills which empower them to learn new technologies, adapt to changes, business 
development, communication etc.
